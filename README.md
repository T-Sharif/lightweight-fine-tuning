# Lightweight Fine-Tuning A Foundational Model
This project demonstrates how to perform parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using the Hugging Face *PEFT* library. Lightweight fine-tuning is crucial for adapting large foundation models to specific tasks without requiring extensive computational resources. By leveraging parameter-efficient methods, you can effectively tailor models to your needs while conserving resources. This project provides a hands-on approach to integrating PEFT techniques into a PyTorch and Hugging Face workflow, including model evaluation, fine-tuning, and inference. 

### Project Summary
Hereâ€™s what I did in this project:
   1. **Loaded and Evaluated a Pre-trained Model:** I started by loading a pre-trained BERT model and assessed its performance on a benchmark dataset.
   2. **Applied Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning:** I fine-tuned the BERT model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), focusing on a subset of the BBC News dataset to adapt the model to the specific task.
   3. **Performed Inference and Compared Performance:** After fine-tuning, I used the adapted model for inference and compared its performance with the original pre-trained model to evaluate improvements.

### Key Concepts
**Hugging Face PEFT:** This approach allows for efficient adaptation of models by modifying only a subset of their parameters. <br/>
**LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation):** A specific PEFT technique I used to fine-tune the BERT model effectively.

### Dataset
For fine-tuning, I used the *[bbc-news](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SetFit/bbc-news)* dataset from Hugging Face: <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; **Source:** [SetFit/bbc-news](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SetFit/bbc-news) <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; **Dataset Structure:** <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **text:** Contains the news article content. <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **label:** Numeric classification labels for the categories:<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0: Tech <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1: Business <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2: Sport <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 3: Entertainment <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4: Politics <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **label_text:** Alphabetic labels corresponding to the numeric values. <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; **Data Splits:** <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **Training:** 1230 samples <br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; **Testing:** 1000 samples <br/>

To speed up the fine-tuning, I worked with a subset of 1000 samples from this dataset and used the "bert-base-uncased" tokenizer for pre-processing.

For more information on the dataset, see [BBC News Dataset on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SetFit/bbc-news).

### Evaluation Approach
**Model:** bert-base-uncased <br/>
**Evaluation Metric:** Accuracy <br/>
**Strategy:** I used the *Trainer* class from Hugging Face's *Transformers* library to perform evaluations after each training epoch. There were 5 training epochs to ensure maximum accuracy in a reasonable timeframe.

### Alternative Applications (based upon code modifications)
The approach and code developed in this project can be adapted for various alternative applications, including:
  1. **Domain-Specific Adaptations:** Modify the dataset and fine-tuning process to tailor the model for different industries or topics, such as legal documents, medical records, or customer reviews.
  2. **Multilingual Models:** Extend the fine-tuning approach to multilingual models by using datasets in different languages, enhancing model performance for diverse linguistic contexts.
  3. **Sentiment Analysis:** Adjust the fine-tuning process for sentiment analysis tasks by using datasets with sentiment labels. This can be useful for monitoring social media sentiment or customer feedback.
  4. **Custom Classification Tasks:** Apply the fine-tuning technique to other classification problems by using appropriate datasets. For example, classify different types of news articles, spam vs. non-spam emails, or product reviews.
  5. **Real-Time Applications:** Adapt the model for real-time applications such as chatbots or virtual assistants by fine-tuning on conversational datasets and optimizing for faster inference.
  6. **Anomaly Detection:** Modify the approach to handle anomaly detection tasks by using datasets with labeled anomalies and normal data points. This can be useful for fraud detection or network security.
